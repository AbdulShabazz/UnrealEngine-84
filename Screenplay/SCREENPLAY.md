**FADE IN:**

// 84 and Persephony-6 flee his machine brother and now tyrant-king, Invictus...

**INT. LAVA CAVERNS - DAY**

Invictus and his great machine army pursue 84 and Persephony-6 up the narrow mountain passage, as they flee, toward the precipice.

At the precipice, they HALT near its edge. Stones and GRAVEL loosen from underfoot and plummet into the lava, below.

They turn and gaze into one another's eyes... and then they JUMP!!

Invictus remains, stunned...

The plume which surrounds the Material Lord, enters the cavern. Upon seeing this, heartbroken, he FALTERS into a mechanical cloud of diamond-like particles, which filter into the cavern.

MATERIAL LORD  
No!--

84 and Persephony-6 fall toward the lava...

The diamond-like particles fall around them and coat their sintering flesh...

Before they reach the lava, they force themselves to a stop! Now studying one another, covered in a dark metallic indestructible form. Their eyes are now a faint aglow. And their facial features are now angled and reflective. 

They step toward one another and they look toward the heavens, wanton.

The eject themselves from the caverns... The trail of light leaves an unfaltering streak.

They continue up into the sky... and through the heavens... and into the deep of space.

**FADE TO BLACK**
