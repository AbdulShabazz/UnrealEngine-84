/*
Danrude unlocks a new property of matter
*/

Danrude unfolds the tesseract, a 4-dimensional space which displays a train of similar 3-dimensional realities, 
in real-time -- each, one nanosecond apart.

DANRUDE
All forms of matter have memory, through gravity. 
All that I need to do is recover the dilation state gravity was in, when matter had that form.

Danrude cordons a group of matter. 

IN HIS HAND

He redials the gravity timeline, a long stream of numbers, to a date in the past: 20492012.199.28.

BACK TO SCENE

The matter coalesces into a solid alien material.

Danrude then faces the open. Allowing local gravity to permeate the space. 

IN HIS HAND

He adjusts his time dial to 32.64.188.

BACK TO SCENE

An entire mechanized city materializes out of nothing.

Danrude, smiles, and studies his creation.

// The genesis of 84

EXT. THE HEAVENS - DAY

The Material Lord materializes within the celestial heavens.

He draws matter from the nearby stars and compacts them into a mass of matter. 
The tightly bound networks of criculating matter begins to glow.
The matter settles into A HUMAN form.

The Material Lord spins bands of lightning into the the form's forehead until the region glows brighter than the others. 
He allows the form to settle onto the ground and cool. The form, a man, springs to life, writhing and breathing.

84
...!

The Material Lord backs away and then vanishes.

The Queen-like Zephyrs lilts toward 84.

The Queen-like Zephyr's appearance is the complete opposite of the Material Lord. 
Unlike a black hole surrounded by dark clouds, that is the Material Lord, the Queen-like Zephyr is an effervescent cloud of light. 
With a bright shining star at her core. She sings to 84, soothing his pain.

84 realizes her presence of sound different from his own, and gains consciousness.
84 REALIZES the repeating patterns of sounds and begins to emulate them.

//The Queen-like Zephyr progresses him through the English vowel sounds one by one.
//He does as best he can to emulate them.

A FEW MONTHS LATER

//The Queen-like Zephyr teaches him names of things.

84 falls to the ground!

QUEEN-LIKE ZEPHYR
Ground!!

84 recovers and wipes his hands, then resting them on his legs.

QUEEN-LIKE ZEPHYR
Legs!

84 REGARDS his hands

//

84 drinks up the core of the fruit.

QUEEN-LIKE ZEPHYR
You've been programmed how to eat, but you've never eaten before.

His stomach still small, he vomits up its contents.

He bites into a delicious fruit, again, savoring, devouring it in its entirety. He vomits up the fruit. 

The Material Lord manifests.

MATERIAL LORD
Stand!!

The Queen-like Zephyr becons him to obey.

QUEEN-LIKE ZEPHYR
Go on. You know how!!

He stands and then he falls; his legs too weak.

The Material Lord evaporates the fat in his legs and lengthens his leg muscles.

84 tries again and bounds to his feet with ease. Bounding relentlessly, to the point of sommersaults! 

MATERIAL LORD
Now...what is your purpose?

84 returns a befuddled look.

QUEEN-LIKE ZEPHYR
No! He's not ready.

84
My purpose?

THE MATERIAL LORD
Have you taught him The Glyphs??
(to 84)
All matter in the universe is given a purpose,
and when that purpose is no longer required, 
the matter is freed and returned to the functors, 
to be used again for a new purpose.

84
The matter is...freed?

THE MATERIAL LORD
What is your purpose?

84 swallows, cautious.

QUEEN-LIKE ZEPHYR
No! He is not ready.

/*
The Material Lord designates the study of mathematics as "mastery of the glyphs".
The Material Lord designates software engineering as "employment of the functors".
The Material Lord designates "mastery of the glyphs" as a subset of "employment of the functors".
*/

INVICTUS
Father, why have you created 84? I thought the line of succession was perfect!

THE MATERIAL LORD
It is. But even at my level of enlightenment, there are things I do not understand. I am level one!!
I am most experienced, and yet there are still things I do not understand. One day, you will be level one.

INVICTUS
But what could possibly be beyond level one? Level one is first. 
Perhaps our understanding of The Glyphs is...incomplete.

THE MATERIAL LORD
There is much you have to learn; 
there is not much I have to learn.

The Material Lord dispels.

/* 
TML realizes Invictus is unable to predict the result of outcomes which is essential to the skill of anticipation and imagination.
The Material Lord conjures Danrude (88), who becomes a ruthless general, to bestow Invictus with confidence, believing he can defeat him.
As an aside, conjures 85-87 are life support elements.
*/

The Queen-like Zephyrs lilts toward 88.

88 stands immediately and he speaks.

88
I am eighty-eight!! 

// Persephony-6 nicknames Invictus, Night.


/* 
Invictus level of enlightenment increases as he masters The Glyphs, 
demonstrated by his ability to use his current level of knowledge to employ the functors to access 
and then ascend each hidden staircase to reach the next level of the Library of Universal Knowledge --
where The Material Lord is pinned at its highest level; The Material Lord predicts him as his successor.
*/

// Invictus achieves the level of enlightenment of The queen-like Zephyr, and exceeds him, believing himself to be 1 (ie. 84).
// 84 and Persephony-6 agree to explore divergent dimensions in order to defeat Danrude.
// 84 defeats Danrude, and heals the atmosphere, causing Invictus to fear him and his new abilities.
// The child-Like Zephyr constructs tiny rockets for 84, allowing him to super jump and reach higher levels.

/*
88 discovers the half-rendered (atomic) state and its ability 
to conceal gravitational effects (such as mass) while exposing the 
remaining transcendental forces, allowing for the construction of advanced materials and megastructures
*/

/*
A precursor to war: The Material Lord revokes Danrude's access to the tesseract library.
*/

EXT. THE FIELDS OF JUDGMENT - DAY

84, Invictus, and The Material Lord await the arrival of 88. They turn and notice, as 

ACROSS THE FIELD

Danrude STROLLS across the fields. He wears heavy body armor, causing an anxious reaction from across the field.

He arrives into their presence.

THE MATERIAL LORD
Why have you shielded all of your extremeties from the radiance?

DANRUDE
It's such a lovely day! I didn't want to make today's visit uneventful.

THE MATERIAL LORD
You have made a discovery, in the tesseract library! Demonstrate what you have learned!!

84 steps back, now apprehensive. Danrude waves him off to "stay calm".

DANRUDE
In due time, Material Lord!!

A calm breeze seems to part an impassable distance between them.

THE MATERIAL LORD
You will demonstrate it!!

Danrude lowers his hand, in defiance; it then glows with a blue energy.

The ground quakes, startling Danrude!

OUTSIDE THE GREAT LIBRARY

Massive organelle barriers block the entrance to the library.

IN THE FIELDS

Danrude, 84, and Invictus watch in shock from across the fields.

THE MATERIAL LORD
88--

DANRUDE
My name is Danrude! I do not accept the name given by you to me.--

Danrude eyes him, grave.

THE MATERIAL LORD
--You have violated and defiled the laws of natural order by witholding your information from the universe. You will not pass, 88!

Danrude clenches his closed fist...

DANRUDE
My name...is Danrude.

The ground quakes again! An organelle being the size of the library itself rises out of the ground and attacks the library!

The Material Lord Vanishes!

IN SPACE

The Material Lord reappears and takes his rightful place at the center of the universe.

/*
88 is an evolution of 84
Invictus, Zephyr, The Material Lord, 84 - unite to defeat 88
*/

IN THE FIELDS

84 and 88 watch the heavens, as the corona from the sunstar 88, a glowing orb of blue molten metal, is progressively torn away, 
toward the rotating black hole in space which The Material Lord has now created.

A nearby SOLAR COLLECTOR ARRAY points toward the events and collects the matriculating light.

IN SPACE

As the sun star's corona encircles the black holes accretion disk, 
small pockets of light are released, before the light itself and shrapnel then descends beyond the event horizon and into the black hole.

ON THE GROUND

Growing uneasy, 84 NOTICES each burst of light is recorded in the reflective panels of the solar array. 

He beckons the attention of The Material Lord.

84
No! Wait! You need to stop!!

THE MATERIAL LORD
It has to be destroyed!

84
No! Don't interact with it; it's performing some form of quantum computation.--

IN THE ABANDONED PERSEPHONY CITY

--The light deck BUCKLES under ihabitant's feet and starts to crumble, as its moorings and its foundation start to give way!

Another organelle, the size of Persephony City, RISES out of the earth!

IN SPACE

The black hole's event-horizon brims with urelenting intermittent bursts of light, which then streak beyond the event horizon into the black hole.

IN THE FIELDS

Each burst of light is reflected in the panels of the solar array. 

/*
Danrude is defeated.
*/

Exhausted, ressting on his knees, Danrude examines the flesh-eating smoke wafting from his hands, and the charred remains of his body. He eyes 84 and then Invictus, disappointed.

84
What you have created here is truly terrible.

DANRUDE
You are capable of even much more, my brother.

Invictus eyes 84, horrified...

84
Never, in a million years, would I have done such terrible deeds.

DANRUDE
You have no idea what you are capable of.

Danrude dies.

/*
The Material Lord cleanses their world of Danrude's mechanized city...
*/

84 glides through the toppling mechanized city, in search of Danrude's gravity dial.

/*
After defeating Danrude, Invictus gives 84 an ultimatum: serve me or be destroyed. 
Invictus achieves the level of enlightenment of The Material Lord, mistakenly believing himself to be, not 1, but 0 (ie. The Multidimensional Material Lord); 
Invictus fears 84, and the upredictability ed of Humanity.
*/

Invictus offers 84 a bowl of black liquid.

INVICTUS
Here! Please, I would feel more comfortable, if you drink it!!

He raises the bowl.

INVICTUS
It is harmless to Organic matter! A way for you to demonstrate your loyalty to me!!

As 84 leans in, the liquid in the bowl VIBRATES. 

84 retreats from it.

84
I want to propose a truce!

INVICTUS
A truce?! We are not at war, brother.

84
Sometimes, it feels like it, though.

84 UNVEILS and admires his tiny light-like source. Invictus, aware of it, shudders away from 84, fearful.

Aware of his discomfort, 84 leaves his presence.

Invictus fear subsides, and is instead replaced with saddness and then anger.

// 84 tries to convince Persephony-6 they need to flee

84
We have to flee.

PERSEPHONY-6
Flee?! But you haven't solved the tesseract!

84
But I have!!

PERSEPHONY-6
And...?

84
It just wraps around on itself, back to precept one again. 
Using what was learned to re-solve the original equation, only adding more dimensions and further complexity...
It goes on forever. The proof never halts. There's no point to it!

PERSEPHONY-6
I'm certain you're missing something. 

PERSEPHONY-6
I have given a new name to Invictus!! He is Night!

/*
The Material Lord is now unable to intervene on his behalf;
He advises him to flee.
Invictus summons an army...
