**Q:** I am developing the outline for a screenstory titled "(I Am Number) 84", with the logline: "A human born into a machine world strives to find purpose to his life."
Working backwards in the markdown, from the climax, using C++ style comments, what is a compelling story outline for the main character, #84, nd his supporting cast ?

**A:** Here's a compelling story outline for the main character, #84, and his supporting cast, working backwards from the climax:

This outline provides a structured narrative that follows 84's journey from a human struggling to find purpose in a machine-dominated world to a transformed being who, alongside Persephony-6, leaves the world behind to explore the universe. The story is driven by 84's relationships with key supporting characters, such as his mentor Zephyr, his love interest Persephony-6, and his tyrannical brother Invictus, as well as his personal growth and the discovery of hidden truths about the machine world.

**Q:** Using C++ style comments, what is a compelling growth arc for the Material Lord and his given mastery of the material world but not the human spirit ?

**A:** Here's a compelling growth arc for the Material Lord, focusing on his mastery of the material world but not the human spirit:

This growth arc portrays the Material Lord as a powerful entity who, despite his mastery over the material world, fails to understand and control the human spirit. As 84 and Persephony-6's rebellion gains momentum, the Material Lord is forced to confront his own limitations and the consequences of his actions. His physical dissolution at the climax symbolizes his surrender and the beginning of a transformation, suggesting that he may come to recognize the power and importance of the human spirit. This arc adds depth to the Material Lord's character and provides a compelling counterpoint to 84 and Persephony-6's journey.

**Q:** I imagine the Material Lord as a convenient perceived villain at the story's outset because he is misunderstood, perceived as harsh by his son Invictus and by 84, which in a way influences the way Invictus believes he should rule. The Material Lord is a master of matter, having created 84 out of the dust atom-by-atom, having reconstructed him from ancient plans from a world long passed. But even at this detailed level of knowing his creation, he cannot control him! It is my hope the Material Lord learns there are infinite axioms yet to be discovered which cannot be altered nor reduced, and so upon discovery change the fabric of reality.

**A:** I appreciate your vision for the Material Lord's character and his role in the story. The idea of him being a misunderstood figure, perceived as a villain by both his son Invictus and 84, adds depth and complexity to the narrative. It's an interesting dynamic that Invictus's beliefs about how he should rule are influenced by his perception of his father's harshness.

The Material Lord's mastery over matter, demonstrated by his ability to create 84 atom-by-atom from ancient plans, showcases his incredible power and knowledge. However, his inability to control 84 despite this intimate level of creation highlights the limitations of his understanding and the power of free will and the human spirit.

The Material Lord's journey of discovering that there are infinite axioms beyond his current understanding, which cannot be altered or reduced, is a compelling character arc. As he uncovers these axioms, they could fundamentally change his perspective and, in turn, the fabric of reality itself.

Here's a revised growth arc for the Material Lord, incorporating these ideas:

This revised growth arc portrays the Material Lord as a complex figure who, despite his mastery over matter, has yet to grasp the full extent of the infinite axioms that govern existence. His journey is one of discovering the limitations of his power and understanding, and learning to respect the human spirit and the potential for growth and change. The climax serves as a turning point, where the Material Lord begins to comprehend these fundamental truths, setting the stage for his transformation and a new perspective on the world he has created.

**Q:** What is a compelling story arc for Invictus, where each character, not only 84, plays a role in shaping him? I imagine Invictus' naive bemusement at the creation of 84 into an otherwise perfect succession line, and the subsequent threat 84 presents to the line of succession line. But his awareness is not awakened at first: Invictus is initially protective of 84 and his humanity and perceived frailty. It is only 84's defiance of his father which brings to him the realization of 84 being a threat.

**A:** Here are compelling story arcs for Persephony-6 and Zephyr, based on your imaginative ideas:

These story arcs for Persephony-6 and Zephyr add depth and complexity to the overall narrative.

Persephony-6's arc explores themes of identity, free will, and the power of genuine connection. Created as a distraction for 84, she grapples with the artificial nature of her memories and purpose, ultimately choosing to embrace her bond with 84 and stand against the oppressive machine world order. Her transformation alongside 84 serves as a symbol of hope and the potential for unity between humans and machines.

Zephyr's arc positions him as an emotional foil and a source of wisdom and guidance. His unique ability to perceive and understand the emotions and motivations of others allows him to reveal the underlying tensions and desires that drive each character. As the conflict escalates, Zephyr works to bridge the gap between 84, Persephony-6, and Invictus, helping them understand each other's perspectives and ultimately contributing to the transformative events that unfold.

Together, these story arcs intertwine with those of 84, Invictus, and the Material Lord, creating a rich and emotionally resonant narrative that explores the complexities of identity, purpose, and the power of understanding and connection.
